# Arvalox SaaS MVP - Phase 1 Timeline

## Project Overview

This document outlines the detailed timeline and task breakdown for building the Arvalox SaaS MVP (Phase 1). The focus is on creating a solid multi-tenant accounts receivable management platform with essential features, keeping costs low while maintaining professional quality.

## Testing Philosophy

**üß™ Comprehensive Backend Testing Strategy**

Every backend feature will be thoroughly tested to ensure reliability and maintainability:

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions, models, and business logic
- **Integration Tests**: Test API endpoints and database interactions
- **Multi-Tenant Tests**: Ensure proper data isolation between organizations
- **Authentication Tests**: Verify JWT tokens and role-based access control
- **Business Logic Tests**: Test invoice calculations, payment allocations, usage limits
- **Database Tests**: Test SQLAlchemy models and relationships
- **API Contract Tests**: Ensure API responses match expected schemas

**Testing Tools:**

- **Pytest** - Primary testing framework
- **Pytest-asyncio** - For async endpoint testing
- **SQLAlchemy Testing** - Database transaction rollbacks
- **Factory Boy** - Test data generation
- **Coverage.py** - Code coverage reporting

**Testing Standards:**

- Minimum 85% code coverage for backend
- All API endpoints must have integration tests
- All business logic functions must have unit tests
- Multi-tenant scenarios must be tested for data isolation
- Error handling and edge cases must be covered
