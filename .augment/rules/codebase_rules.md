Don't overcomplicate things, I like KISS (keep it simple, stupid) and DRY (don't repeat yourself) principles. I don't like too much comments and unnecceary comments. Write maintainable code. On git commits: I like atomic commits. Commit often. I prefer short commit messages. If the changes are much, add a description.
