Don't overcomplicate things, I like KISS (keep it simple, stupid). I don't like too much comments and unnecceary comments. Write maintainable and very important, DRY (Do Not Repeat Yourself) code. On git commits: I like atomic commits. Commit often. I prefer short commit messages. If the changes are much, add a description.

On the backend, before you run any terminal command, ensure the virtual environment at backend/.venv is activated
