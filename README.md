## What This Project Actually Does

Imagine you run a small business - let's say you sell custom t-shirts.

### The Problem:

- You make t-shirts for customers
- You send them bills (invoices)
- Some customers pay immediately, others pay late, some forget to pay
- You lose track of who owes you money
- You can't easily see how much money people owe you total

### What My App Does:

- **Customer List** - Keep track of all my customers (names, emails, addresses)
- **Make Bills** - Create professional invoices like "Hey John, you owe me $50 for those 5 t-shirts"
- **Track Payments** - When John pays $25, you record it. Now he only owes $25.
- **See Who's Late** - Show you "Sarah owes $100 and it's been 45 days - call her!"
- **Reports** - Tell you "This month you're owed $2,500 total, and $800 of that is overdue"

### In Even Simpler Terms:

It's like a digital notebook that helps businesses:

- Remember who owes them money
- Send professional bills
- Track when people pay
- Know who's paying late
- See their money situation at a glance

### Real World Example:

Instead of using messy Excel sheets or paper notebooks to track "John owes me $50, Sarah paid $30, Mike is 2 months late with $200" - you have a clean, professional app that does it all automatically.

**That's it! It's basically a "Who Owes Me Money" tracker for businesses!** 😄
